## 👋 Overview

I am a Junior QA Automation Engineer (Python) with a strong foundation in Manual Testing.

This portfolio showcases my practical experience in:
- manual testing (test cases and bug reports),
- UI test automation using Python, Selenium, and Pytest,
- Page Object Model (POM) architecture,
- Continuous Integration with GitHub Actions.

The projects below demonstrate my progression from manual QA fundamentals to automated UI testing, following real-world QA workflows and best practices.

# QA Portfolio

This repository serves as a **QA portfolio hub**, showcasing my practical experience in both **Manual Testing** and **QA Automation**.

The portfolio demonstrates a structured progression from manual QA fundamentals to UI test automation with CI integration.

##  QA Automation Projects

###  QA Login Automation (UI)

**Repository:**  
 https://github.com/pers1fal/qa-login-automation

**Description:**  
UI test automation project for login functionality using **Python, Selenium, Pytest**, and **Page Object Model (POM)** architecture.  
Includes **GitHub Actions CI** for automated test execution.

**What is covered:**
- Automated UI tests for login functionality
- Positive and negative login scenarios
- Page Object Model (POM) implementation
- Pytest fixtures for WebDriver setup
- Headless browser execution
- Continuous Integration with GitHub Actions

**Technologies Used:**
- Python 3.10+
- Selenium WebDriver
- Pytest
- Page Object Model (POM)
- Git & GitHub
- GitHub Actions (CI)

**Continuous Integration (CI):**
- Tests are automatically executed on every push to the `main` branch
- Runs in a Linux environment
- Uses headless Google Chrome
- Automatically installs dependencies
- Executes `pytest` and reports results

 CI status confirms that the tests are stable and runnable in an isolated environment.

##  Demo Application Under Test

Both projects are based on the same demo application:  
 https://practicetestautomation.com/practice-test-login/

This allows a clear comparison between **manual testing** and **automation testing** approaches.

---

##  Portfolio Goal

This portfolio demonstrates:
- Strong foundation in **Manual QA**
- Transition to **QA Automation**
- Understanding of real-world QA workflows
- Experience with test documentation and automation frameworks
- CI/CD integration for automated testing
